# RatingApp-iOS
iOS demo app for rating the item and displaying in reorder after rating. 

1. Pick your top 10+ fav books, movies, video games, food, or
whatever you wish. Build an iOS app using the Swift programming
language that lists these items. Initial list of any of these item can be
stored in json file no need to write a backend service.

2. Create a rating system where you can rate each item. Order the list
by the highest rated item to lowest rated item. Re-order the list, if
needed, when user ranks an item.

3. Randomly rate items at random times, also re-ordering the list as
necessary. To elaborate this more put a button called RANDOM
RATING and on click of this button, the code will start rating random
item at random time with random rating. And on same button press
again it will stop random rating.
